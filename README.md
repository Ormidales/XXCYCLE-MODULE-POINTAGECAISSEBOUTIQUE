# XXCYCLE-MODULE-POINTAGECAISSEBOUTIQUE

This is a PHP file for a PrestaShop module. It defines a class called PointageEncaissementBoutique which extends the Module class provided by PrestaShop. The module adds a custom interface in the back-office of a PrestaShop store that allows the shopkeepers to keep track of payments, particularly those made with credit cards. The module defines several methods, including install, uninstall, getContent, and postProcess. The install and uninstall methods are used to install and uninstall the module, respectively. The getContent method is called when the module's configuration page is accessed, and it returns the form that allows users to configure the module. The postProcess method is called when the form is submitted and it saves the configuration settings.
